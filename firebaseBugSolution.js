To resolve permission-denied errors, ensure your Firebase security rules grant the necessary access to your application.  Here's an example of how to correct overly restrictive rules:

```javascript
// Correct Security Rules (firebase.rules)
// This rule grants read and write access to authenticated users
 service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents { 
    match /{document=**} { 
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null; 
    } 
  }
}
```

Ensure that your client-side code is correctly authenticated and has the necessary permissions before attempting any database operations.  Proper authentication is often the key to resolving these errors.
